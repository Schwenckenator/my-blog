<p>As I'm starting to get older, I'm having more and more opinions about all sorts of things. And considering the
    stranglehold big tech companies have on social media, the best way I think to get my thoughts out there, will be my
    very own site!</p>
<p>I don't expect to be famous, or have anyone read this at all really. But I want to use this site as a record of my
    personal projects, and also to be the impetus to actually make those projects.</p>
<p>These are the goals I'm setting out for this site.
    - I want it to be dead simple to use
    - I want to write my articles in markdown
    - I want my article list, or previous / next links to be generated automatically.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, I'm going to avoid using fancy JavaScript frameworks and static site generators. I don't want to
    deal with databases, or any server nonsense.</p>
<p>I think this can be a learning opportunity, so I'm going to write a static site generator from scratch using
    (probably?) python. </p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>To start though, I just need to get html onto a server. I've gotten myself this domain https://schwenckenator.dev
    from cloudflare, and I'm going to use their pages service to serve my static html.</p>
<p>I whipped up a public <a href="https://github.com/Schwenckenator/my-blog">GitHub repository</a> where I'll keep this
    site's code.
    Next, I deployed it using the guide here. It was really quite simple!
    https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-anything/</p>

    But, I got my first error! I need to put something into the build folder.</p>
<p>Using the "ship it now, make it good later" philosophy, I simply shoved a hello world template into the build folder,
    and pushed it!</p>

    Success!</p>
<h2>Actually making the site</h2>
<p>So, I'm not much of a web designer. My day job (using Next/React, blegh) has me fully focused on the interactivity,
    and the css gets passed onto the designers. </p>
<p>However, I also want this site to look <em>okay</em>. So, I've enlisted the help of <a
        href="https://picocss.com/">picocss</a>!
    After playing with tailwind a bit, I find it can get kinda bloaty with the classes, and I'm avoiding building where
    I can, so a css framework is perfect. I also just like the look of picocss. </p>
<p>Next, I need to actually write the html for this sites pages. I think later I'll rewrite these as a template, but for
    now, I'm happy with just hard-coding the html and pushing it into the build folder. </p>
<p>After futzing a bit, I've made my first draft of my main page! I've taken inspiration from https://qwool.github.io/,
    I think its a nice simple place to start.</p>

</html>
<p>```</p>
<p>This has got everything I really need for now. A place to put my articles, and a simple header and footer. </p>
<p>I'll want to add &lt;-prev / next -&gt; links too, but I can do that once I actually have multiple articles to show.
</p>
<p>I'll also have to make the home page a list at some point. So much left to do!</p>
<h2>My first build step</h2>
<p>Now, it's time to write some actual code.
    At the moment, I'm uploading the build folder to git directly. But I'd rather have the build folder be ignored by
    git, and have cloudflare build my project on deployment. </p>
<p>Since there is no actual build step for the site yet, for now I think I can get away with copying a source directory
    to the build directory like so:
    <code>bash
        cp -r ./src ./build</code>
</p>
<p>Later, when the site actually has a build step, I'll have to convince cloudflare to run a python script. </p>
<h2>Finishing up this article</h2>
<p>So far, I've been writing this article in Obsidian, outside of the repo. So as a final step, I need to move this
    markdown file into the repo, and run a python script on it to convert it to HTML.</p>
<p>I installed the markdown package with pip
    <code>bash
        pip install markdown</code>
</p>
<p>And tested it out with the interactive REPL
    ```python</p>
<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>import markdown
                markdown.markdown("# Hey Mum")
                '
            <h1>Hey Mum</h1>'</p>
            <p>```</p>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Satisfied that this works, I wrote a small terminal script that loads the file from the first argument, and spits the
    result out into the second.</p>
<p>First I checked that I could read terminal arguments
    ```python
    import sys</p>
<p>print(sys.argv)</p>
<h1>Input "python3 convert.py first second third"</h1>
<h1>Output ['convert.py', 'first', 'second', 'third']</h1>
<p>```</p>
<p>Then I put the code to convert the file, and let her rip!
    (With lots of printing, just as God intended.)
    ```python
    import markdown
    import sys</p>
<p>read_path = sys.argv[1]
    write_path = sys.argv[2]</p>
<p>if not read_path or not write_path:
    print('Arg 1 is read path, Arg 2 is write path')
    return</p>
<p>with open(read_path, 'r') as f:
    text = f.read()
    print('Markdown:')
    print(text)
    html = markdown.markdown(text)
    print('HTML:')
    print(html)</p>
<p>with open(write_path, 'w') as f:
    f.write(html)</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>And I got an error!
    <code>File "/home/matt/projects/my-blog/convert.py", line 9
        return
        ^^^^^^
        SyntaxError: 'return' outside function</code>
</p>
<p>So I swapped the <code>if .. return</code> for a couple of <code>assert</code> statements</p>
<p>```python</p>
<p>import markdown
    import sys</p>
<p>read_path = sys.argv[1]
    write_path = sys.argv[2]</p>
<p>assert read_path, "Read file path and write file path not included!"
    assert write_path, "Write file path not included!"</p>
<p>with open(read_path, 'r') as f:
    text = f.read()
    print('Markdown:')
    print(text)
    html = markdown.markdown(text)
    print('HTML:')
    print(html)</p>
<p>with open(write_path, 'w') as f:
    f.write(html)</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>And it works! I mean, I got an output file at least. There's still a lot of work cleaning it up, but it's better than
    nothing!</p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>So, all I've got left to do is put finish writing this article, put it through my converter, clean it up, and
    publish!</p>
<p>Next, I think I want to make my python script crawl through the pages folder, converting all of the files, and saving
    the html to the build folder.
    I'll also need to make the index page a list of all my articles. At the moment, this is all I've got, so homepage it
    is!</p>
<p>I could also work on automatically building links in, but I want to chip away at this project, slowly building it up
    so I don't burn out. And once I'm in the groove of writing a post every week or so, maybe I'll start working on
    games, or another tool after finishing this.</p>
<p>Until next time, pona tawa sina!</p>
