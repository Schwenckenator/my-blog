I have gone and done a thing! I have called it [brainlife](https://brainlife.schwenckenator.dev) .

Why brainlife? Well I got the idea for a programmable 2d grid, a la Conway's Game of life. And I had read a lot about esoteric programming languages. One of these 'esolangs' as they are often called, is brainfuck. Now brainfuck is famous for breaking brains, and I didn't want to go that hard. But there is something about the simplicity of single character commands that felt... replicable. 

So I spent a little time and did just that! It's open sourced (link to repo on the brainlife site) so you can see my awful code, and there's a help page to learn how to use it. 

I've included an example which does Conway's Game of life, but you could probably do a lot with this. I'm just not smart enough to program in my own language. 

That's it! Until next time!
