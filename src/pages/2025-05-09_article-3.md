Plan for this article
- [ ] Sort pages in newest first order
- [ ] Add next / previous links to page template
- [ ] add tags to articles, display them on homepage links
	- [ ] Bonus points later, make tag pages
- [ ] Replace obsidian links with markdown links before building ??

Welcome back to my series about building this very website!

Early readers, if there are indeed early readers, may have noticed that my homepage currently displays my articles in chronological order. While this is fine when I have two articles, it is less desirable with more articles. 

## Sorting my articles

So the first order of business for this time, is to reverse the order that articles are displayed in. I'm going to lean on my markdown metadata from last time, and use the `publish_date` value to order articles in reverse chronological order.

Which is easy enough! First I loop through all of the markdown files, and extract their metadata and content. The code I had from last time was mostly left intact, but I'll do the build operation later. 
```python
# A list of pages to save for the index page
pages = []

for f in glob.iglob(f"{source_dir}/**/*.md"):
    # Open markdown file
    with open(f, 'r') as file:
        # extract frontmatter and raw markdown
        metadata, raw = frontmatter.parse(file.read())
        # convert content to html
        content = commonmark.commonmark(raw)

    # if the page is not published, don't include it in the build
    if not metadata['is_published']:
        continue

    # Save data in class
    page_data = PageData(f, metadata, content)
    # Append to pages list
    pages.append(page_data)
```

I also created a small class to hold the data, along with the file path.
```python
class PageData():
    """A data class to hold page data"""

    def __init__(self, filepath, metadata, content):
        self.filepath = filepath
        self.metadata = metadata
        self.content = content
```

Then the sorting magic. The built in sort is usually more than sufficient, especially in cases like this. I provide a lambda function to tell the sort to sort by the `PageData`'s date, and also to reverse it. 
```python
# Sort the pages by `publish_date`
pages.sort(key=lambda p: p.metadata['publish_date'], reverse=True)
```

With that done, the rest of the build goes mostly the same, except I loop over this sorted array rather than the files directly. If you want to know exactly what changes, you're more than welcome to look at the repo on Github and inspect the diff!

## Direct links to other articles
Now that I have the articles in the right order, I want to add links at the top & bottom that link to the next article, so people can go to the next thing without having to go back to the home page.

First, I'll need to add a spot for links in the template, like so.

```html
<section class="container">
	<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
+	<section>
+		<a href="{{ previous_href }}">← {{ previous_title }}</a>
+		<span style="margin: 0 10px;"> | </span>
+		<a href="{{ next_href }}">{{ next_title }} →</a>
+	</section>
	<section>
		<em>Published: {{ publish_date }}</em>
	</section>
+	<hr>
	{{ content }}
</section>
```

I've added a few new variables here, including the link urls and titles for the previous and next articles. I also added a `<hr>` just before the article proper starts because I think that looks good.  

With the template sorted, I need to make a way to specify the next / previous articles in the page data. I added a little something to the markdown render loop, taking advantage of the metadata which will automatically be rendered by my template function. To do this, I needed to switch the simple for loop into an enumerate loop, which is something new to me!
```python
~ for index, page in enumerate(pages):	
	#... other code
	
+	# Prepare other article links
+   if pages[index-1]:
+       prev = pages[index-1]
+       page.metadata['previous_href'] = prev.metadata['slug']
+       page.metadata['previous_title'] = prev.metadata['title']
+   if pages[index+1]:
+       next = pages[index+1]
+       page.metadata['next_href'] = next.metadata['slug']
+       page.metadata['next_title'] = next.metadata['title']
    
    # replace the other handles
    html = template_replace(page.metadata, html)
```

Annnd that broke my script. My javascript brain has failed me again. 
So I changed the `if` statement to check against length, rather than seeing if the element exists. I also forgot that my list is in reverse order (newest first), so I swapped the prev / next around.
```python
    # Prepare other article links
    if index > 0:
        next = pages[index-1]
        page.metadata['next_href'] = next.metadata['slug']
        page.metadata['next_title'] = next.metadata['title']
    if index < len(pages) - 1:
        prev = pages[index+1]
        page.metadata['previous_href'] = prev.metadata['slug']
        page.metadata['previous_title'] = prev.metadata['title']
```

And the links work! But, it's revealed another problem...

## Unused template elements
Once the links were working, I noticed something on the first page.
![The template {{ previous_title }} is still there](template-still-there.png)

This makes total sense, but it's a bigger problem that it seems. 
Because the template has these special sections, the simple solution is to check after all substitutions have been made, and delete any remaining template handles. Which would work to get rid of the visible handle.

But the problem I now have with that, is I've put the template content within a `<a>` tag. Even if I delete the handles, the tag will remain, as will the arrow. I need to find a way to not render the entire tag when there is not a valid link. 

My solution, more partials! This link sounds like a kind of component, so I'm going to make a next link partial, and a previous link partial. If this was react or another js framework, I'd bundle them into a single component with logic, but why write smart code when lot dumb code do trick?

The partials look like this
```html
<!-- Previous -->
<a href="{{ previous_href }}">← {{ previous_title }}</a>

<!-- Next -->
<a href="{{ next_href }}">{{ next_title }} →</a>
```

And the updated page template looks like this.
```html
<section>
	{{ prev_link }}
	<span style="margin: 0 10px;"> | </span>
	{{ next_link }}
</section>
```

Now lets make it actually work. Leaning on the template function I already have, I modified the link building to render the partial, then assign the link metadata the whole tag.
```python
    if index > 0:
        next = pages[index-1]
        link_metadata = {
            'href': next.metadata['slug'],
            'title': next.metadata['title'],
        }
        link = template_replace(page.metadata, template['next-link'])
        page.metadata['next_link'] = link
```

With this in place, the template handle if still of course there, but the `<a>` tag is gone.
![{{ prev_link }} is visible, but it's no longer a link](template-there-but-tag-gone.png)

Now, I could write some code that deletes any left over handles on finishing. But that seems a bit like magic, and I want this to be a low magic build system. I can foresee pulling my hair out because my template won't render the thing I'm giving it, but I've made a simple spelling mistake. No thanks.

I'm going to explicitly write in a None handler, that returns an empty string to delete the element. 
```python
def template_replace(metadata, template):
    """replaces the template placeholder with metadata"""
    result = template
    for key, value in metadata.items():
        print('metadata key - ', key, '; value - ', value)
        if value is None:
~           print("It's NONE, deleting the handler")
~           result = result.replace(f"{{{{ {key} }}}}", "")
            continue
        # ...
```

Then I use the else blocks of my prev / next checks to assign the metadata link key to None.
```python
    if index > 0:
        next = pages[index-1]
        link_metadata = {
            'href': next.metadata['slug'],
            'title': next.metadata['title'],
        }
        link = template_replace(page.metadata, template['next-link'])
        page.metadata['next_link'] = link
+   else:
+       # Delete the template handle
+       page.metadata['next_link'] = None

```

And just like that, the first page's previous link is gone!
