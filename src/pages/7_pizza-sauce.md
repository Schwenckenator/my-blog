Guys, homemade pizza sauce is so fucking easy and it tastes so good!

I made a homemade pizza (frozen bases but close enough).
The bottle of pizza sauce I bought ages ago was running out, so I thought that I'd make my own.

I found a recipe, and it was simple as. 
Canned tomato, bit of garlic, oil, Italian herbs sugar, salt
Put all of that into a pan, and cook it on a low heat until it reduces. And its so fucking good!

Blows my store-bought pizza sauce out of the water, not even close. 
Never buy pizza sauce. It's easy, and tastes way better.  

Recipe? Look it up yourself, or just wing it.
